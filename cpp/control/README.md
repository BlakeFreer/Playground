# Control

Implementing concepts from MECHTRON 4AX3 - Predictive and Intelligent Control.

## Roadmap

- Linear Least Squares via Normal Equation
- Gradient Descent solver
- State space classes & solving methods
- Kalman Filter
- Luenberger Observer
- Extended Kalman filter
  - Is this code any different than the standard KF?
- Control
  - Converging to optimal policy
  - Learning
  - Exploration
