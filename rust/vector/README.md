# Riesz

_Rust Linear Algebra, named after my favourite math theorem._

## Objectives

I want to implement some behaviour

- Matrix multiplication
- Vector math (dot, cross, scalar multiplication)
- Determinants
- Inverses (with Rust's error handling, of course)
- Eigenvalues? SVD?

I also want to practice these Rust features:

- Type & Const Generics
- Operator overloading
- Write lots of `impl`s
- Type conversions / custom casting
- String formatting

### Non-objectives

- Compete with [`nalgebra`](https://nalgebra.org/), [`ndarray`](https://docs.rs/ndarray/latest/ndarray/), or any other major Rust library.
